## Problem Statement

Given is an integer $r$.

How many times is the area of a circle of radius $r$ larger than the area of a circle of radius $1$?

It can be proved that the answer is always an integer under the constraints given.

## Constraints

- $1 \leq r \leq 100$
- All values in input are integers.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $r$

## Output

Print the area of a circle of radius $r$, divided by the area of a circle of radius $1$, as an integer.

```input1
2
```

```output1
4
```

The area of a circle of radius $2$ is $4$ times larger than the area of a circle of radius $1$.

Note that output must be an integer - for example, `4.0` will not be accepted.

```input2
100
```

```output2
10000
```
