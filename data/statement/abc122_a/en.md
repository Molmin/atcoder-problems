## Problem Statement

On the Planet AtCoder, there are four types of bases: `A`, `C`, `G` and `T`. `A` bonds with `T`, and `C` bonds with `G`.

You are given a letter $b$ as input, which is `A`, `C`, `G` or `T`. Write a program that prints the letter representing the base that bonds with the base $b$.

## Constraints

- $b$ is one of the letters `A`, `C`, `G` and `T`.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $b$

## Output

Print the letter representing the base that bonds with the base $b$.

```input1
A
```

```output1
T
```

```input2
G
```

```output2
C
```
