## Problem Statement

Given are integers $N$, $L$, and $R$.
Count the number of integers $x$ that satisfy both of the following conditions.

- $L \leq x \leq R$
- $(x \oplus N) &lt; N$ (Here, $\oplus$ denotes the bitwise $\mathrm{XOR}$.ï¼‰

    
        What is the bitwise $\mathrm{XOR}$?
    
    

        The bitwise $\mathrm{XOR}$ of integers $A$ and $B$, $A\oplus B$, is defined as follows:
        

- When $A\oplus B$ is written in base two, the digit in the $2^k$'s place ($k \geq 0$) is $1$ if exactly one of $A$ and $B$ is $1$, and $0$ otherwise.

        For example, we have $3\oplus 5 = 6$ (in base two: $011\oplus 101 = 110$).  
    

## Constraints

- $1 \leq N \leq 10^{18}$
- $1 \leq L \leq R \leq 10^{18}$
- All values in input are integers.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $N$ $L$ $R$

## Output

Print the answer.

```input1
2 1 2
```

```output1
1
```

For $x=1$, $L \leq x \leq R$ is satisfied, but $(x \oplus N) &lt; N$ is not.
For $x=2$, both conditions are satisfied.
There is no other $x$ that satisfies the conditions.
