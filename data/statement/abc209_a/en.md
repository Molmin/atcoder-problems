## Problem Statement

How many integers not less than $A$ and not more than $B$ are there?

## Constraints

- $1 \leq A \leq 100$
- $1 \leq B \leq 100$
- $A$ and $B$ are integers.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $A$ $B$

## Output

Print the number of integers not less than $A$ and not more than $B$.

```input1
2 4
```

```output1
3
```

We have three integers not less than $2$ and not more than $4$: $2$, $3$, $4$, so we should print $3$.

```input2
10 100
```

```output2
91
```

```input3
3 2
```

```output3
0
```

We have no integers not less than $3$ and not more than $2$, so we should print $0$.
