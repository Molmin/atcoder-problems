Find the minimum prime number greater than or equal to $X$.

## Notes

A prime number is an integer greater than $1$ that cannot be evenly divided by any positive integer except $1$ and itself.

For example, $2$, $3$, and $5$ are prime numbers, while $4$ and $6$ are not.

## Constraints

- $2 \le X \le 10^5$
- All values in input are integers.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

## Output

Print the minimum prime number greater than or equal to $X$.

```input1
