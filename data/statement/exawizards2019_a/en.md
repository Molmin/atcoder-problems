## Problem Statement

You are given three integers $A, B$ and $C$.

Determine if there exists an equilateral triangle whose sides have lengths $A, B$ and $C$.

## Constraints

- All values in input are integers.
- $1 \leq A,B,C \leq 100$

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $A$ $B$ $C$

## Output

If there exists an equilateral triangle whose sides have lengths $A, B$ and $C$, print `Yes`; otherwise, print `No`.

```input1
2 2 2
```

```output1
Yes
```

- There exists an equilateral triangle whose sides have lengths $2, 2$ and $2$.

```input2
3 4 5
```

```output2
No
```

- There is no equilateral triangle whose sides have lengths $3, 4$ and $5$.
