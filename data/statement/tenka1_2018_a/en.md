## Problem Statement

You are given a string $S$ of length $2$ or $3$ consisting of lowercase English letters. If the length of the string is $2$, print it as is; if the length is $3$, print the string after reversing it.

## Constraints

- The length of $S$ is $2$ or $3$.
- $S$ consists of lowercase English letters.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $S$

## Output

If the length of $S$ is $2$, print $S$ as is; if the length is $3$, print $S$ after reversing it.

```input1
abc
```

```output1
cba
```

As the length of $S$ is $3$, we print it after reversing it.

```input2
ac
```

```output2
ac
```

As the length of $S$ is $2$, we print it as is.
