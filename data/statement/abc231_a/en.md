## Problem Statement

Let us assume that water pressure depends only on depth and is $\dfrac{x}{100}$ megapascal at a depth of $x$ meters.

What is the water pressure in megapascals at a depth of $D$ meters?

## Constraints

- $1 \leq D \leq 10000$
- $D$ is an integer.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $D$

## Output

Print the answer. Your output will be considered correct when its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most $10^{-3}$.

```input1
1000
```

```output1
10
```

The water pressure at a depth of $1000$ meters is $10$ megapascal. Outputs such as `10.0` and `9.999999` would also be accepted.

```input2
50
```

```output2
0.5
```

```input3
3141
```

```output3
31.41
```
