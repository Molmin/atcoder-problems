## Problem Statement

You are given four integers $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. Find the number of integers between $A$ and $B$ (inclusive) that can be evenly divided by neither $C$ nor $D$.

## Constraints

- $1\leq A\leq B\leq 10^{18}$
- $1\leq C,D\leq 10^9$
- All values in input are integers.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $A$ $B$ $C$ $D$

## Output

Print the number of integers between $A$ and $B$ (inclusive) that can be evenly divided by neither $C$ nor $D$.

```input1
4 9 2 3
```

```output1
2
```

$5$ and $7$ satisfy the condition.

```input2
10 40 6 8
```

```output2
23
```
