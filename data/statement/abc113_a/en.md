## Problem Statement

There is a train going from Station $A$ to Station $B$ that costs $X$ yen (the currency of Japan).

Also, there is a bus going from Station $B$ to Station $C$ that costs $Y$ yen.

Joisino got a special ticket. With this ticket, she can take the bus for half the fare if she travels from Station $A$ to Station $B$ by train and then travels from Station $B$ to Station $C$ by bus.

How much does it cost to travel from Station $A$ to Station $C$ if she uses this ticket?

## Constraints

- $1 \leq X,Y \leq 100$
- $Y$ is an even number.
- All values in input are integers.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $X$ $Y$

## Output

If it costs $x$ yen to travel from Station $A$ to Station $C$, print $x$.

```input1
81 58
```

```output1
110
```

- The train fare is $81$ yen.
- The train fare is $58$ ‚ÅÑ $2=29$ yen with the $50$% discount.

Thus, it costs $110$ yen to travel from Station $A$ to Station $C$.

```input2
4 54
```

```output2
31
```
