Takahashi is standing on a two-dimensional plane, facing north. Find the minimum positive integer $K$ such that Takahashi will be at the starting position again after he does the following action $K$ times:

- Go one meter in the direction he is facing. Then, turn $X$ degrees counter-clockwise.

## Constraints

- $1 \leq X \leq 179$
- $X$ is an integer.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $X$

## Output

Print the number of times Takahashi will do the action before he is at the starting position again.
