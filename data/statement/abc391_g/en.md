## Problem Statement

You are given a lowercase English string $S$ of length $N$ and an integer $M$. For each $k=0,1,\ldots,N$, solve the following problem:

- There are $26^M$ lowercase English strings of length $M$. Among these, find the number, modulo $998244353$, of strings whose longest common subsequence with $S$ has length exactly $k$.

## Constraints

- $1\leq N\leq 10$
- $1\leq M\leq 100$
- $N$ and $M$ are integers.
- $S$ is a lowercase English string of length $N$.

## Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $N$ $M$
> 
> $S$

## Output

Let $\mathrm{ans}_i$ be the answer for $k=i$. Print the answers in the following format:

> $\mathrm{ans}_0$ $\mathrm{ans}_1$ $\ldots$ $\mathrm{ans}_N$

```input1
2 2
ab
```

```output1
576 99 1
```

The answers for $k=0,1,2$ are as follows:

- For $k=0$: Among length $2$ lowercase English strings, those with a longest common subsequence of length $0$ with `ab` include strings such as `cd`, `re`, `zz`, totaling $576$.
- For $k=1$: Among length $2$ lowercase English strings, those with a longest common subsequence of length $1$ with `ab` include strings such as `ac`, `wa`, `ba`, totaling $99$.
- For $k=2$: Among length $2$ lowercase English strings, there is $1$ string (`ab`) whose longest common subsequence with `ab` has length $2$.
