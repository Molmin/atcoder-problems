## Problem Statement

Smeke has decided to participate in AtCoder Beginner Contest (ABC) if his current rating is less than $1200$, and participate in AtCoder Regular Contest (ARC) otherwise.

You are given Smeke's current rating, $x$. Print `ABC` if Smeke will participate in ABC, and print `ARC` otherwise.

## Constraints

- $1 \leq x \leq 3{,}000$
- $x$ is an integer.

## Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $x$

## Output

Print the answer.

```input1
1000
```

```output1
ABC
```

Smeke's current rating is less than $1200$, thus the output should be `ABC`.

```input2
2000
```

```output2
ARC
```

Smeke's current rating is not less than $1200$, thus the output should be `ARC`.
