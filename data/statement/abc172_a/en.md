## Problem Statement

Given an integer $a$ as input, print the value $a + a^2 + a^3$.

## Constraints

- $1 \leq a \leq 10$
- $a$ is an integer.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $a$

## Output

Print the value $a + a^2 + a^3$ as an integer.

```input1
2
```

```output1
14
```

When $a = 2$, we have $a + a^2 + a^3 = 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14$.

Print the answer as an input. Outputs such as `14.0` will be judged as incorrect.

```input2
10
```

```output2
1110
```
