## Problem Statement

AtCoder Inc. holds a contest every Saturday.

There are two types of contests called ABC and ARC, and just one of them is held at a time.

The company holds these two types of contests alternately: an ARC follows an ABC and vice versa.

Given a string $S$ representing the type of the contest held last week, print the string representing the type of the contest held this week.

## Constraints

- $S$ is `ABC` or `ARC`.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $S$

## Output

Print the string representing the type of the contest held this week.

```input1
ABC
```

```output1
ARC
```

They held an ABC last week, so they will hold an ARC this week.
