Find the sum of integers between $1$ and $N$ (inclusive) that are not multiples of $A$ or $B$.

## Constraints

- $1 \leq N, A,B \leq 10^9$
- All values in input are integers.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $N$ $A$ $B$

## Output

Print the answer.

```input1
10 3 5
```

```output1
22
```

The integers between $1$ and $10$ (inclusive) that are not multiples of $3$ or $5$ are $1,2,4,7$, and $8$, whose sum is $1+2+4+7+8 =22$.
