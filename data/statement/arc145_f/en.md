## Problem Statement

Find the number, modulo $998244353$, of non-decreasing sequences $A=(A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_N)$ of length $N$ consisting of integers between $0$ and $M$ (inclusive) that satisfy the following, for each $K=0,1,\ldots,\mathrm{MOD}-1$:

- the sum of the elements in $A$ is congruent to $K$ modulo $\mathrm{MOD}$.

What is a non-decreasing sequence?
A sequence $B$ is non-decreasing if and only if $B_i \leq B_{i+1}$ for every integer ($1 \le i \le |B| - 1$), where $|B|$ is the length of $B$.

## Constraints

- $1 \leq N ,M\leq 10^6$
- $1\leq \mathrm{MOD}\leq 500$
- All values in input are integers.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $N$ $M$ $\mathrm{MOD}$

## Output

For each $K=0,1,\ldots,\mathrm{MOD}-1$, print the number, modulo $998244353$, of sequences that satisfy the condition.

2 2 4
```

```output1

There are $6$ non-decreasing sequences of length $2$ consisting of integers between $0$ and $2$: $(0, 0), (0, 1),(0,2), (1,1),(1,2),(2,2)$. Here, we have:

- <p>$2$ sequences whose sums are congruent to $0$ modulo $4$: $(0,0),(2,2)$;</p>
- <p>$1$ sequence whose sum is congruent to $1$ modulo $4$: $(0,1)$;</p>
- <p>$2$ sequences whose sums are congruent to $2$ modulo $4$: $(0,2),(1,1)$;</p>
- <p>$1$ sequence whose sum is congruent to $3$ modulo $4$: $(1,2)$.</p>

```input2
