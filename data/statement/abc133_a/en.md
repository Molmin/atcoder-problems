## Problem Statement

$N$ of us are going on a trip, by train or taxi.

The train will cost each of us $A$ yen (the currency of Japan).

The taxi will cost us a total of $B$ yen.

How much is our minimum total travel expense?

## Constraints

- All values in input are integers.
- $1 \leq N \leq 20$
- $1 \leq A \leq 50$
- $1 \leq B \leq 50$

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $N$ $A$ $B$

## Output

Print an integer representing the minimum total travel expense.

```input1
4 2 9
```

```output1
8
```

The train will cost us $4 \times 2 = 8$ yen, and the taxi will cost us $9$ yen, so the minimum total travel expense is $8$ yen.

```input2
4 2 7
```

```output2
7
```

```input3
4 2 8
```

```output3
8
```
