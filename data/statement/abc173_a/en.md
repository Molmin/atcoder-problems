## Problem Statement

We will buy a product for $N$ yen (the currency of Japan) at a shop.

If we use only $1000$-yen bills to pay the price, how much change will we receive?

Assume we use the minimum number of bills required.

## Constraints

- $1 \leq N \leq 10000$
- $N$ is an integer.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $N$

## Output

Print the amount of change as an integer.

```input1
1900
```

```output1
100
```

We will use two $1000$-yen bills to pay the price and receive $100$ yen in change.

```input2
3000
```

```output2
0
```

We can pay the exact price.
