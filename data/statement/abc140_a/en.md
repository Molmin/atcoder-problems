## Problem Statement

Takahashi is going to set a $3$-character password.

How many possible passwords are there if each of its characters must be a digit between $1$ and $N$ (inclusive)?

## Constraints

- $1 \leq N \leq 9$
- $N$ is an integer.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $N$

## Output

Print the number of possible passwords.

```input1
2
```

```output1
8
```

There are eight possible passwords: `111`, `112`, `121`, `122`, `211`, `212`, `221`, and `222`.

```input2
1
```

```output2

```

There is only one possible password if you can only use one kind of character.
