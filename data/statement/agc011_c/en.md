## Problem Statement

Takahashi has received an undirected graph with $N$ vertices, numbered $1$, $2$, ..., $N$.
The edges in this graph are represented by $(u_i, v_i)$.
There are no self-loops and multiple edges in this graph.

Based on this graph, Takahashi is now constructing a new graph with $N^2$ vertices, where each vertex is labeled with a pair of integers $(a, b)$ ($1 \leq a \leq N$, $1 \leq b \leq N$).
The edges in this new graph are generated by the following rule:

- Span an edge between vertices $(a, b)$ and $(a', b')$ if and only if both of the following two edges exist in the original graph: an edge between vertices $a$ and $a'$, and an edge between vertices $b$ and $b'$.

How many connected components are there in this new graph?

## Constraints

- $2 \leq N \leq 100,000$
- $0 \leq M \leq 200,000$
- $1 \leq u_i &lt; v_i \leq N$
- There exists no pair of distinct integers $i$ and $j$ such that $u_i = u_j$ and $v_i = v_j$.

## Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $N$ $M$
> 
> $u_1$ $v_1$
> 
> $u_2$ $v_2$
> 
> :
> 
> $u_M$ $v_M$
