## Problem Statement

Takahashi has rolled three dice. They are showing numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$ on the top faces.

Find the sum of the numbers on the bottom faces.

Here, each of these dice is a standard cubic die, where the sum of the numbers on opposite faces is $7$.

## Constrains

- $1 \leq a, b, c \leq 6$
- All values in input are integers.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $a$ $b$ $c$

## Output

Print the sum of the numbers on the bottom faces of the three dice.

```input1
1 4 3
```

```output1
13
```

The numbers on the bottom faces are $6$, $3$, and $4$.
We have $6 + 3 + 4 = 13$, which should be printed.

```input2
5 6 4
```

```output2
6
```
