## Problem Statement

The number $105$ is quite special - it is odd but still it has eight divisors.
Now, your task is this: how many odd numbers with exactly eight positive divisors are there between $1$ and $N$ (inclusive)?

## Constraints

- $N$ is an integer between $1$ and $200$ (inclusive).

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $N$

## Output

Print the count.

```input1
105
```

```output1
1
```

Among the numbers between $1$ and $105$, the only number that is odd and has exactly eight divisors is $105$.

```input2
7
```

```output2
0
```

$1$ has one divisor. $3$, $5$ and $7$ are all prime and have two divisors. Thus, there is no number that satisfies the condition.
