## Problem Statement

AtCoDeer the deer has found two positive integers, $a$ and $b$.
Determine whether the concatenation of $a$ and $b$ in this order is a square number.

## Constraints

- $1$ $\leq$ $a,b$ $\leq$ $100$
- $a$ and $b$ are integers.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $a$ $b$

## Output

If the concatenation of $a$ and $b$ in this order is a square number, print `Yes`; otherwise, print `No`.

```input1
1 21
```

```output1
Yes
```

As $121$ $=$ $11$ Ã— $11$, it is a square number.

```input2
