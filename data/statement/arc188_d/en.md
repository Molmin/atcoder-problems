## Problem Statement

You are going to create $N$ sequences of length $3$, satisfying the following conditions.

- For each of $k = 1,2,3$, the following holds:-   - Among the $k$-th elements of the sequences, each integer from $1$ through $N$ appears exactly once.

For this sequence of sequences, define sequences $a=(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_N)$ and $b=(b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_N)$ as follows.

- Let $s_i$ be the $i$-th sequence, and let $t_i$ be the reverse of the $i$-th sequence. When all of these are sorted in lexicographical order, $s_i$ comes $a_i$-th, and $t_i$ comes $b_i$-th.
- Here, if there are identical sequences among the $2N$ sequences, $a$ and $b$ are not defined.

Therefore, if $a$ and $b$ are defined, each integer from $1$ through $2N$ appears exactly once in the concatenation of $a$ and $b$.

You are given sequences $A$ and $B$ of length $N$, where each element of $A$ is an integer between $1$ and $2N$, and each element of $B$ is either an integer between $1$ and $2N$ or $-1$.
Also, in the concatenation of $A$ and $B$, each integer other than $-1$ appears at most once.

How many pairs of sequences $a,b$ are there such that $a$ and $b$ are defined and the following holds for each integer $i$ from $1$ through $N$?

- $a_i = A_i$.
- $b_i = B_i$ if $B_i \neq -1$.

Find the count modulo $998244353$.

## Constraints

- $2 \leq N \leq 3000$
- $1 \leq A_i \leq 2N$
- $1 \leq B_i \leq 2N$ or $B_i = -1$.
- In the concatenation of $A$ and $B$, each integer other than $-1$ appears at most once. That is,-   - $A_i \neq A_j$ if $i \neq j$.
-   - $B_i \neq B_j$ if $i \neq j$ and $B_i,B_j \neq -1$.
-   - $A_i \neq B_j$.
- All input values are integers.

## Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $N$
> 
> $A_1$ $A_2$ $\ldots$ $A_N$
> 
> $B_1$ $B_2$ $\ldots$ $B_N$

## Output

For example, consider creating the following three sequences:

1. $(1,2,3)$
2. $(2,1,1)$
3. $(3,3,2)$

In this case, when sorting $s_i$ and $t_i$ lexicographically, we have:

$t_2 = (1,1,2) &lt; s_1 = (1,2,3) &lt; s_2 = (2,1,1) &lt; t_3 = (2,3,3) &lt; t_1 = (3,2,1) &lt; s_3 = (3,3,2)$

Thus, $(a_1,a_2,a_3,b_1,b_2,b_3) = (2,3,6,5,1,4)$. Here, $a$ matches the given $A$, and the second element of $b$ also matches that of $B$, so this is one pair of sequences $a,b$ satisfying the conditions.

On the other hand, if we create the following three sequences, $s_1$ and $t_1$ become identical, so $a$ and $b$ are not defined.

1. $(1,2,1)$
2. $(2,1,3)$
3. $(3,3,2)$

In fact, $a=(2,3,6), b=(5,1,4)$ is the only pair of sequences satisfying the conditions.
