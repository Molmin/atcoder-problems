## Problem Statement

We have $N$ polygons on the $xy$-plane.<br>
Every side of these polygons is parallel to the $x$- or $y$-axis, and every interior angle is $90$ or $270$ degrees. All of these polygons are simple.<br>
The $i$-th polygon has $M_i$ corners, the $j$-th of which is $(x_{i, j}, y_{i, j})$.<br>
The sides of this polygon are segments connecting the $j$-th and $(j+1)$-th corners. (Assume that $(M_i+1)$-th corner is the $1$-st corner.)

A polygon is simple when...

for any two of its sides that are not adjacent, they do not intersect (cross or touch) each other.

You are given $Q$ queries.
For each $i = 1, 2, \dots, Q$, the $i$-th query is as follows.

- Among the $N$ polygons, how many have the point $(X_i + 0.5, Y_i + 0.5)$ inside them?

## Constraints

- $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$
- $4 \leq M_i \leq 10^5$
- Each $M_i$ is even.
- $\sum_i M_i \leq 4 \times 10^5$
- $0 \leq x_{i, j}, y_{i, j} \leq 10^5$
- $(x_{i, j}, y_{i, j}) \neq (x_{i, k}, y_{i, k})$ if $j \neq k$.
- $x_{i, j} = x_{i, j+1}$ for $j = 1, 3, \dots M_i-1$.
- $y_{i, j} = y_{i, j+1}$ for $j = 2, 4, \dots M_i$. (Assume $y_{i, M_i +1} = y_{i, 1}$.)
- The given polygons are simple.
- $1 \leq Q \leq 10^5$
- $0 \leq X_i, Y_i \lt 10^5$
- All values in input are integers.

Although the polygons are simple, they may not be convex.
