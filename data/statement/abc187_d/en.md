## Problem Statement

AtCoder City will hold a mayoral election. The candidates are Aoki and Takahashi.<br>
The city consists of $N$ towns, the $i$-th of which has $A_i$ pro-Aoki voters and $B_i$ pro-Takahashi voters. There are no other voters.<br>
Takahashi can make a speech in each town.<br>
If he makes a speech in some town, all voters in that town, pro-Takahashi or pro-Aoki, will vote for Takahashi.<br>
On the other hand, if he does not make a speech in some town, the pro-Aoki voters in that town will vote for Aoki, and the pro-Takahashi voters will not vote.<br>
To get more votes than Aoki, in how many towns does Takahashi need to make speeches at least?
