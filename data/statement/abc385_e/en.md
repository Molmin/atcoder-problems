## Problem Statement

A "Snowflake Tree" is defined as a tree that can be generated by the following procedure:

1. Choose positive integers $x,y$.
2. Prepare one vertex.
3. Prepare $x$ more vertices, and connect each of them to the vertex prepared in step 2.
4. For each of the $x$ vertices prepared in step 3, attach $y$ leaves to it.

The figure below shows a Snowflake Tree with $x=4,y=2$. The vertices prepared in steps 2, 3, 4 are shown in red, blue, and green, respectively.

You are given a tree $T$ with $N$ vertices. The vertices are numbered $1$ to $N$, and the $i$-th edge $(i=1,2,\dots,N-1)$ connects vertices $u_i$ and $v_i$.

Consider deleting zero or more vertices of $T$ and the edges adjacent to them so that the remaining graph becomes a single Snowflake Tree. Find the minimum number of vertices that must be deleted. Under the constraints of this problem, it is always possible to transform $T$ into a Snowflake Tree.

## Constraints

- $3 \leq N \leq 3 \times 10^5$
- $1 \leq u_i &lt; v_i \leq N$
- The given graph is a tree.
- All input values are integers.

## Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $N$
> 
> $u_1$ $v_1$
> 
> $u_2$ $v_2$
> 
> $\vdots$
> 
> $u_{N-1}$ $v_{N-1}$
