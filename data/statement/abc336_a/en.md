## Problem Statement

For a positive integer $X$, the **Dragon String** of level $X$ is a string of length $(X+3)$ formed by one `L`, $X$ occurrences of `o`, one `n`, and one `g` arranged in this order.

You are given a positive integer $N$. Print the Dragon String of level $N$.<br>
Note that uppercase and lowercase letters are distinguished.

## Constraints

- $1 \leq N \leq 2024$
- $N$ is an integer.

## Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
