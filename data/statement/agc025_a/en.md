## Problem Statement

Takahashi has two positive integers $A$ and $B$.

It is known that $A$ plus $B$ equals $N$.
Find the minimum possible value of "the sum of the digits of $A$" plus "the sum of the digits of $B$" (in base $10$).

## Constraints

- $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$
- $N$ is an integer.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $N$

## Output

Print the minimum possible value of "the sum of the digits of $A$" plus "the sum of the digits of $B$".

```input1
15
```

```output1
6
```

When $A=2$ and $B=13$, the sums of their digits are $2$ and $4$, which minimizes the value in question.

```input2
100000
```

```output2
10
```
