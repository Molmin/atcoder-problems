## Problem Statement

A non-negative integer $X$ is called a palindrome number if its decimal representation (without leading zeros) is a palindrome.<br>
For example, $363$, $12344321$, and $0$ are all palindrome numbers.  

Find the $N$-th smallest palindrome number.

## Constraints

- $1 \leq N \leq 10^{18}$
- $N$ is an integer.

## Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $N$

## Output

Print the $N$-th smallest palindrome number.

```input1
46
```

```output1
363
```

The 46th smallest palindrome number is $363$.

```input2
1
```

```output2
0
```

```input3
1000000000000000000
```

```output3
90000000000000000000000000000000009
