## Problem Statement

A sport event is held in June of every year whose remainder when divided by $4$ is $2$.<br>
Suppose that it is now January of the year $Y$.  In what year will this sport event be held next time?

## Constraints

- $2000 \leq Y \leq 3000$
- $Y$ is an integer.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $Y$

## Output

Print the answer.

```input1
2022
```

```output1
2022
```

The remainder when $2022$ is divided by $4$ is $2$, so if it is now January of $2022$, the next games will be held in June of the same year.

```input2
2023
```

```output2
2026
```

```input3
