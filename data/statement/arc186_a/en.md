## Problem Statement

For two $N \times N$ matrices $A$ and $B$ whose elements are $0$ or $1$, we say that $A$ and $B$ are **similar** if they satisfy the following conditions:

- The sums of corresponding rows are equal. That is, $A_{i,1} + \dots + A_{i,N} = B_{i,1} + \dots + B_{i,N}$ for any $i=1,\dots,N$.
- The sums of corresponding columns are equal. That is, $A_{1,j} + \dots + A_{N,j} = B_{1,j} + \dots + B_{N,j}$ for any $j=1,\dots,N$.

Furthermore, for an $N \times N$ matrix $A$ whose elements are $0$ or $1$, and integers $i,j$ ($1 \leq i,j \leq N$), we say that the element at row $i$ column $j$ is **fixed** if $A_{i,j} = B_{i,j}$ holds for any matrix $B$ that is similar to $A$.

Answer the following $Q$ queries:

- The $i$-th query: If there exists an $N \times N$ matrix whose elements are $0$ or $1$ such that exactly $K_i$ elements are fixed, output `Yes`; otherwise, output `No`.

## Constraints

- $2 \le N \le 30$
- $1 \le Q \le N^2+1$
- $0 \le K_i \le N^2$
- $K_i \ne K_j (1 \le i &lt; j \le Q)$
- All inputs are integers

## Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $N$ $Q$
> 
> $K_1$
> 
> $K_2$
> 
> $\vdots$
> 
> $K_Q$

## Output

Output $Q$ lines.
For the $i$-th line $(1 \le i \le Q)$, output the answer for the $i$-th query.

```output1

No
```

Query 1:
For example, the following matrix $X$ has exactly $0$ fixed elements.

```output1
1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 1
```

This is because all the following matrices, obtained by cyclically shifting the columns, are similar to $X$, and each element can be either $0$ or $1$.

```output1
0 0 1
1 0 0
0 1 0
```
```output1
0 1 0
0 0 1
1 0 0
```

Query 2:
For example, the following matrix $X$ has exactly $9$ fixed elements.

```output1
0 0 1
0 1 1
1 1 1
```

This is because no other matrix similar to $X$ exists, and all elements are fixed.

Query 3:
No matrix exists with exactly $7$ fixed elements.
