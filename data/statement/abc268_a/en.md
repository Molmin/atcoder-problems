## Problem Statement

Print how many distinct integers there are in given five integers $A, B, C, D$, and $E$.

## Constraints

- $0 \leq A, B, C, D, E \leq 100$
- All values in input are integers.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $A$ $B$ $C$ $D$ $E$

## Output

Print the answer.

```input1
31 9 24 31 24
```

```output1
3
```

In the given five integers $31, 9, 24, 31$, and $24$, there are three distinct integers $9, 24$, and $31$.
Thus, $3$ should be printed.

```input2
0 0 0 0 0
