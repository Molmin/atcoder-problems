## Problem Statement

How many ways are there to choose two distinct positive integers totaling $N$, disregarding the order?

## Constraints

- $1 \leq N \leq 10^6$
- $N$ is an integer.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $N$

## Output

Print the answer.

```input1
4
```

```output1
1
```

There is only one way to choose two distinct integers totaling $4$: to choose $1$ and $3$. (Choosing $3$ and $1$ is not considered different from this.)

```input2
999999
```

```output2
499999
```
