## Problem Statement

Iroha has a sequence of positive integers $A = (A_1, A_2, \dots, A_N)$ of length $N$ ($N \ge 1$).<br>
She generated a string $S$ using $A$ as follows:

- Start with $S =$ `|`.
- For $i = 1, 2, \dots, N$, perform the following operations in order:-   - Append $A_i$ copies of `-` to the end of $S$.
-   - Then, append one `|` to the end of $S$.

Given the generated string $S$, reconstruct the sequence $A$.

## Constraints

- $S$ is a string of length between $3$ and $100$, inclusive, generated by the method in the problem statement.
- $A$ is a sequence of positive integers of length at least $1$.

## Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $S$

## Output

Print the answer in the following format, with elements separated by spaces in a single line:

> $A_1$ $A_2$ $\dots$ $A_N$

```input1
|---|-|----|-|-----|
```

```output1
3 1 4 1 5
```

$S =$ `|---|-|----|-|-----|` is generated by $A = (3, 1, 4, 1, 5)$.

```input2
|----------|
```

```output2
10
```

```input3
|-|-|-|------|
```

```output3
1 1 1 6
```
