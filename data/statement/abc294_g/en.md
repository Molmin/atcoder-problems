## Problem Statement

You are given a tree $T$ with $N$ vertices.
Edge $i$ $(1\leq i\leq N-1)$ connects vertices $u _ i$ and $v _ i$, and has a weight of $w _ i$.

Process $Q$ queries in order. There are two kinds of queries as follows.

- `1 i w` : Change the weight of edge $i$ to $w$.
- `2 u v`ï¼šPrint the distance between vertex $u$ and vertex $v$.

Here, the distance between two vertices $u$ and $v$ of a tree is the smallest total weight of edges in a path whose endpoints are $u$ and $v$.

## Constraints

- $1\leq N\leq 2\times10^5$
- $1\leq u _ i,v _ i\leq N\ (1\leq i\leq N-1)$
- $1\leq w _ i\leq 10^9\ (1\leq i\leq N-1)$
- The given graph is a tree.
- $1\leq Q\leq 2\times10^5$
- For each query of the first kind,-   - $1\leq i\leq N-1$, and
-   - $1\leq w\leq 10^9$.
- For each query of the second kind,-   - $1\leq u,v\leq N$.
- There is at least one query of the second kind.
- All values in the input are integers.

## Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $N$
> 
> $u _ 1$ $v _ 1$ $w _ 1$
> 
> $u _ 2$ $v _ 2$ $w _ 2$
> 
> $\vdots$
> 
> $u _ {N-1}$ $v _ {N-1}$ $w _ {N-1}$
> 
> $Q$
> 
> $\operatorname{query} _ 1$
> 
> $\operatorname{query} _ 2$
> 
> $\vdots$
> 
> $\operatorname{query} _ Q$

Here, $\operatorname{query} _ i$ denotes the $i$-th query and is in one of the following format:

> $1$ $i$ $w$
> $2$ $u$ $v$

## Output

Print $q$ lines, where $q$ is the number of queries of the second kind.
The $j$-th line $(1\leq j\leq q)$ should contain the answer to the $j$-th query of the second kind.

Each query should be processed as follows.

- The first query asks you to print the distance between vertex $2$ and vertex $3$. Edge $1$ and edge $2$, in this order, form a path between them with a total weight of $9$, which is the minimum, so you should print $9$.
- The second query asks you to print the distance between vertex $1$ and vertex $5$. Edge $3$ and edge $4$, in this order, form a path between them with a total weight of $19$, which is the minimum, so you should print $19$.
- The third query changes the weight of edge $3$ to $1$.
- The fourth query asks you to print the distance between vertex $1$ and vertex $5$. Edge $3$ and edge $4$, in this order, form a path between them with a total weight of $11$, which is the minimum, so you should print $11$.
