## Problem Statement

You are given a string $S$ of length $N$ consisting of lowercase English letters.

Process $Q$ queries of the following two types:

- Type $1$: change the $i_q$-th character of $S$ to $c_q$. (Do nothing if the $i_q$-th character is already $c_q$.)
- Type $2$: answer the number of different characters occurring in the substring of $S$ between the $l_q$-th and $r_q$-th characters (inclusive).

## Constraints

- $N$, $Q$, $i_q$, $l_q$, and $r_q$ are integers.
- $S$ is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.
- $c_q$ is a lowercase English letter.
- $1 \leq N \leq 500000$
- $1 \leq Q \leq 20000$
- $|S| = N$
- $1 \leq i_q \leq N$
- $1 \leq l_q \leq r_q \leq N$
- There is at least one query of type $2$ in each testcase.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $N$
> 
> $S$
> 
> $Q$
> 
> $Query_1$
> 
> $\vdots$
> 
> $Query_Q$

Here, $Query_i$ in the $4$-th through $(Q+3)$-th lines is one of the following:

> $1$ $i_q$ $c_q$

> $2$ $l_q$ $r_q$

## Output

For each query of type $2$, print a line containing the answer.

```input1
7
abcdbbd
6
2 3 6
1 5 z
2 1 1
1 4 a
1 7 d
2 1 7
```

```output1
3
1
5
```

In the first query, `cdbb` contains three kinds of letters: `b` , `c` , and `d`, so we print $3$.

In the second query, $S$ is modified to `abcdzbd`.

In the third query, `a` contains one kind of letter: `a`, so we print $1$.

In the fourth query, $S$ is modified to `abcazbd`.

In the fifth query, $S$ does not change and is still `abcazbd`.

In the sixth query, `abcazbd` contains five kinds of letters: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `z`, so we print $5$.
