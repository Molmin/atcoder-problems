## Problem Statement

There is a grid with $H$ horizontal rows and $W$ vertical columns, where each square contains a digit between $1$ and $9$.
For each pair of integers $(i, j)$ such that $1 \leq i \leq H$ and $1 \leq j \leq W$, the digit written on the square at the $i$-th row from the top and $j$-th column from the left is $c_{i, j}$.

Using this grid, Takahashi and Aoki will play together.
First, Takahashi chooses a square and puts a piece on it.
Then, the two will repeat the following procedures, 1. through 4., $N$ times.

1. Takahashi does one of the following two actions.1.    - Move the piece to another square that **shares a row** with the square the piece is on.
2.    - Do nothing.
2. Takahashi writes on a blackboard the digit written on the square the piece is on.
3. Aoki does one of the following two actions.1.    - Move the piece to another square that **shares a column** with the square the piece is on.
2.    - Do nothing.
4. Aoki writes on the blackboard the digit written on the square the piece is on.

After that, there will be $2N$ digits written on the blackboard. Let $d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_{2N}$ be those digits, in the order they are written.
The two boys will concatenate the $2N$ digits in this order to make a $2N$-digit integer $X := d_1d_2\ldots d_{2N}$.

Find the number, modulo $998244353$, of different integers that $X$ can become.

## Constraints

- $2 \leq H, W \leq 10$
- $1 \leq N \leq 300$
- $1 \leq c_{i, j} \leq 9$
- All values in input are integers.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $H$ $W$ $N$
> 
> $c_{1, 1}$$c_{1, 2}$$\cdots$$c_{1, W}$
> 
> $c_{2, 1}$$c_{2, 2}$$\cdots$$c_{2, W}$
> 
> $\vdots$
> 
> $c_{H, 1}$$c_{H, 2}$$\cdots$$c_{H, W}$

## Output

Print the number, modulo $998244353$, of different integers that $X$ can become.

```input1
2 2 1
31
41
```

```output1
5
```

Below is one possible scenario.

- First, Takahashi puts the piece on $(1, 2)$.
- Takahashi moves the piece from $(1, 2)$ to $(1, 1)$, and then writes the digit $3$ written on $(1, 1)$.
- Aoki moves the piece from $(1, 1)$ to $(2, 1)$, and then writes the digit $4$ written on $(2, 1)$.

In this case, we have $X = 34$.<br>
Below is another possible scenario.

- First, Takahashi puts the piece on $(2, 2)$.
- Takahashi keeps the piece on $(2, 2)$, and then writes the digit $1$ written on $(2, 2)$.
- Aoki moves the piece from $(2, 2)$ to $(1, 2)$, and then writes the digit $1$ written on $(1, 2)$.

In this case, we have $X = 11$.
Other than these, $X$ can also become $33$, $44$, or $43$, but nothing else.<br>
That is, there are five integers that $X$ can become, so we print $5$.

```input2
2 3 4
777
777
```

```output2
1
```

$X$ can only become $77777777$.

```input3
10 10 300
3181534389
4347471911
4997373645

```

```output3

```

Be sure to find the count modulo $998244353$.
