## Problem Statement

Find the number of *palindromic numbers* among the integers between $A$ and $B$ (inclusive).
Here, a palindromic number is a positive integer whose string representation in base $10$ (without leading zeros) reads the same forward and backward.

## Constraints

- $10000 \leq A \leq B \leq 99999$
- All input values are integers.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $A$ $B$

## Output

Print the number of *palindromic numbers* among the integers between $A$ and $B$ (inclusive).

```input1
11009 11332
```

```output1
4
```

There are four integers that satisfy the conditions: $11011$, $11111$, $11211$ and $11311$.

```input2
31415 92653
```

```output2
612
```
