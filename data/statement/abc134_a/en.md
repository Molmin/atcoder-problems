## Problem Statement

It is known that the area of a regular dodecagon inscribed in a circle of radius $a$ is $3a^2$.

Given an integer $r$, find the area of a regular dodecagon inscribed in a circle of radius $r$.

## Constraints

- $1 \leq r \leq 100$
- $r$ is an integer.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $r$

## Output

Print an integer representing the area of the regular dodecagon.

```input1
4
```

```output1
48
```

The area of the regular dodecagon is $3 \times 4^2 = 48$.

```input2
15
```

```output2
675
```

```input3
80
```

```output3
19200
