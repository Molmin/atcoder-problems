## Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer $N$.
Find the minimum positive integer divisible by both $2$ and $N$.

## Constraints

- $1 \leq N \leq 10^9$
- All values in input are integers.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $N$

## Output

Print the minimum positive integer divisible by both $2$ and $N$.

```input1
3
```

```output1
6
```

$6$ is divisible by both $2$ and $3$.
Also, there is no positive integer less than $6$ that is divisible by both $2$ and $3$.
Thus, the answer is $6$.

```input2
10
```

```output2
10
```

```input3
999999999
```

```output3
