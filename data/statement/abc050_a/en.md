## Problem Statement

Joisino wants to evaluate the formula "$A$ $op$ $B$".
Here, $A$ and $B$ are integers, and the binary operator $op$ is either `+` or `-`.
Your task is to evaluate the formula instead of her.

## Constraints

- $1 \leq A,B \leq 10^9$
- $op$ is either `+` or `-`.

## Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $A$ $op$ $B$

## Output

Evaluate the formula and print the result.

```input1
1 + 2
```

```output1
3
```

Since $1 + 2 = 3$, the output should be $3$.

```input2
5 - 7
```

```output2
-2
```
