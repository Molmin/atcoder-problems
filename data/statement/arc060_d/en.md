## Problem Statement

Let $x$ be a string of length at least $1$.
We will call $x$ a *good* string, if for any string $y$ and any integer $k (k \geq 2)$, the string obtained by concatenating $k$ copies of $y$ is different from $x$.
For example, `a`, `bbc` and `cdcdc` are good strings, while `aa`, `bbbb` and `cdcdcd` are not.

Let $w$ be a string of length at least $1$.
For a sequence $F=(\,f_1,\,f_2,\,...,\,f_m)$ consisting of $m$ elements,
we will call $F$ a *good representation* of $w$, if the following conditions are both satisfied:

- For any $i \, (1 \leq i \leq m)$, $f_i$ is a good string.
- The string obtained by concatenating $f_1,\,f_2,\,...,\,f_m$ in this order, is $w$.

For example, when $w=$`aabb`, there are five good representations of $w$:

- $($`aabb`$)$
- $($`a`$,$`abb`$)$
- $($`aab`$,$`b`$)$
- $($`a`$,$`ab`$,$`b`$)$
- $($`a`$,$`a`$,$`b`$,$`b`$)$

Among the good representations of $w$, the ones with the smallest number of elements are called the *best representations* of $w$.
For example, there are only one best representation of $w=$`aabb`: $($`aabb`$)$.

You are given a string $w$. Find the following:

- the number of elements of a best representation of $w$
- the number of the best representations of $w$, modulo $1000000007 \, (=10^9+7)$

(It is guaranteed that a good representation of $w$ always exists.)

## Constraints

- $1 \leq |w| \leq 500000 \, (=5 \times 10^5)$
- $w$ consists of lowercase letters (`a`-`z`).

## Partial Score

- $400$ points will be awarded for passing the test set satisfying $1 \leq |w| \leq 4000$.

## Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $w$

## Output

Print $2$ lines.

- In the first line, print the number of elements of a best representation of $w$.
- In the second line, print the number of the best representations of $w$, modulo $1000000007$.

```input1

```

```output1

- In this case, there are $3$ best representations of $2$ elements:-   - $($`b`$,$`cbc`$)$
-   - $($`bc`$,$`bc`$)$
-   - $($`bcb`$,$`c`$)$
