## Problem Statement

The function ReLU is defined as follows:

![Figure](https://img.atcoder.jp/ghi/relu.png)

Given an integer $x$, find $ReLU(x)$.

## Constraints

- $x$ is an integer.
- $-10 \leq x \leq 10$

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $x$

## Output

Print the answer as an integer.

```input1
1
```

```output1
1
```

We have $1 \geq 0$, so $ReLU(1) = 1$.

```input2
0
```

```output2
0
```

```input3
-1
```

```output3
0
```
