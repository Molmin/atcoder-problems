## Problem Statement

Given are a character $S$, which is `Y` or `N`, and another character $T$, which is `A`, `B`, or `C`.

If $S$ is `Y`, print $T$ uppercased.

If $S$ is `N`, print $T$ as it is.

## Constraints

- $S$ is `Y` or `N`.
- $T$ is `a`, `b`, or `c`.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $S$
> 
> $T$

## Output

Print a character as specified in the problem statement.

```input1
Y
a
```

```output1
A
```

Since $S$ is `Y`, we should print $T$ - which is `a` - uppercased, that is, `A`.

```input2
N
b
```

```output2
b
```

Since $S$ is `Y`, we should print $T$ - which is `b` - as it is.
