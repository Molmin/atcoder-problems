Score : $100$ points

## Problem Statement

Print the circumference of a circle of radius $R$.

## Constraints

- $1 \leq R \leq 100$
- All values in input are integers.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $R$

## Output

Print the circumference of the circle.
Your output is considered correct if and only if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most $10^{-2}$.

```input1
1
```

```output1
6.28318530717958623200
```

Since we accept an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-2}$, $6.28$ is also an acceptable output, but $6$ is not.

```input2
73
```

```output2
458.67252742410977361942
