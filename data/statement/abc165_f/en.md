## Problem Statement

We have a tree with $N$ vertices, whose $i$-th edge connects Vertex $u_i$ and Vertex $v_i$.
Vertex $i$ has an integer $a_i$ written on it.
For every integer $k$ from $1$ through $N$, solve the following problem:

- We will make a sequence by lining up the integers written on the vertices along the shortest path from Vertex $1$ to Vertex $k$, in the order they appear. Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence of this sequence.

Here, the longest increasing subsequence of a sequence $A$ of length $L$ is the subsequence $A_{i_1} , A_{i_2} , ... , A_{i_M}$ with the greatest possible value of $M$ such that $1 \leq i_1 &lt; i_2 &lt; ... &lt; i_M \leq L$ and $A_{i_1} &lt; A_{i_2} &lt; ... &lt; A_{i_M}$.

## Constraints

- $2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5$
- $1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$
- $1 \leq u_i , v_i \leq N$
- $u_i \neq v_i$
- The given graph is a tree.
- All values in input are integers.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $N$
> 
> $a_1$ $a_2$ $...$ $a_N$
> 
> $u_1$ $v_1$
> 
> $u_2$ $v_2$
> 
> $:$
> 
> $u_{N-1}$ $v_{N-1}$

## Output

Print $N$ lines. The $k$-th line, print the length of the longest increasing subsequence of the sequence obtained from the shortest path from Vertex $1$ to Vertex $k$.

For example, the sequence $A$ obtained from the shortest path from Vertex $1$ to Vertex $5$ is $1,2,5,3,4$. Its longest increasing subsequence is $A_1, A_2, A_4, A_5$, with the length of $4$.
