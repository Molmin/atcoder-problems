## Problem Statement

Find the largest square number not exceeding $N$. Here, a *square number* is an integer that can be represented as the square of an integer.

## Constraints

- $1 \leq N \leq 10^9$
- $N$ is an integer.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $N$

## Output

Print the largest square number not exceeding $N$.

```input1
10
```

```output1
9

$10$ is not square, but $9 = 3 \times 3$ is. Thus, we print $9$.

```input2
81
```

```output2
81
```
