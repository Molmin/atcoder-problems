## Problem Statement

There are $N$ trees standing in a row from left to right. The $i$-th tree $(1 \leq i \leq N)$ from the left, Tree $i$, has the height of $H_i$.

You will now cut down all these $N$ trees in some order you like. Formally, you will choose a permutation $P$ of $(1, 2, \ldots, N)$ and do the operation below for each $i=1, 2, 3, ..., N$ in this order.

- Cut down Tree $P_i$, that is, set $H_{P_i}$ to $0$, at a cost of $H_{P_i-1}+H_{P_i}+H_{P_i+1}$.

Here, we assume $H_0=0,H_{N+1}=0$.

In other words, the cost of cutting down a tree is the total height of the tree and the neighboring trees just before doing so.

Find the number of permutations $P$ that minimize the total cost of cutting down the trees. Since the count may be enormous, print it modulo $(10^9+7)$.

## Constraints

- $1 \leq N \leq 4000$
- $1 \leq H_i \leq 10^9$
- All values in input are integers.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $N$
> 
> $H_1$ $H_2$ $\ldots$ $H_N$

## Output

Print the number of permutations $P$, modulo $(10^9+7)$, that minimize the total cost of cutting down the trees.

There are two permutations $P$ that minimize the total cost: $(1,3,2)$ and $(3,1,2)$.

Below, we will show the process of cutting down the trees for $P=(1,3,2)$, for example.

- First, Tree $1$ is cut down at a cost of $H_0+H_1+H_2=6$.
- Next, Tree $3$ is cut down at a cost of $H_2+H_3+H_4=6$.
- Finally, Tree $2$ is cut down at a cost of $H_1+H_2+H_3=2$.

The total cost incurred is $14$.
