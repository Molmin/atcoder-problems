Score : $600$ points

## Problem Statement

We have a bipartite graph with $L$ vertices to the left and $R$ vertices to the right.<br>
Takahashi will install surveillance cameras in these vertices.<br>
Installing cameras incurs the following cost.

- $A_i$ yen (the Japanese currency) for each camera installed in the $i$-th $(1 \le i \le L)$ vertex to the left;
- $B_j$ yen (the Japanese currency) for each camera installed in the $j$-th $(1 \le j \le R)$ vertex to the right.

It is allowed to install multiple cameras on the same vertex.

Find the minimum amount of money needed to install cameras to satisfy the following condition.

- For every pair of integers $(i, j)$ such that $1 \le i \le L, 1 \le j \le R$, there is a total of $C_{i,j}$ or more cameras installed in the $i$-th vertex to the left and $j$-th vertex to the right.

## Constraints

- All values in input are integers.
- $1 \le L,R \le 100$
- $1 \le A_i,B_i \le 10$
- $0 \le C_{i,j} \le 100$

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $L$ $R$
> 
> $A_1$ $A_2$ $\dots$ $A_L$
> 
> $B_1$ $B_2$ $\dots$ $B_R$
> 
> $C_{1,1}$ $C_{1,2}$ $\dots$ $C_{1,R}$
> 
> $C_{2,1}$ $C_{2,2}$ $\dots$ $C_{2,R}$
> 
> $\vdots$
> 
> $C_{L,1}$ $C_{L,2}$ $\dots$ $C_{L,R}$

## Output

Print the answer as an integer.

```

```output1
37
```

You can achieve the objective for $37$ yen as follows, which is the minimum amount required.

- Install $2$ cameras on the $1$-st vertex in the left.
- Install $3$ cameras on the $2$-nd vertex in the left.
- Install $2$ cameras on the $3$-rd vertex in the left.
- Install $1$ camera on the $1$-st vertex in the right.
- Install $1$ camera on the $3$-rd vertex in the right.
