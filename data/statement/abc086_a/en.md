## Problem Statement

AtCoDeer the deer found two positive integers, $a$ and $b$.
Determine whether the product of $a$ and $b$ is even or odd.

## Constraints

- $1$ $\leq$ $a,b$ $\leq$ $10000$
- $a$ and $b$ are integers.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $a$ $b$

## Output

If the product is odd, print `Odd`; if it is even, print `Even`.

```input1
3 4
```

```output1
Even
```

As $3 \times 4 = 12$ is even, print `Even`.

```input2
1 21
```

```output2

```

As $1 \times 21 = 21$ is odd, print `Odd`.
