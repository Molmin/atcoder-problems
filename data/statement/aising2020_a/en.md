## Problem Statement

How many multiples of $d$ are there among the integers between $L$ and $R$ (inclusive)?

## Constraints

- All values in input are integers.
- $1 \leq L \leq R \leq 100$
- $1 \leq d \leq 100$

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $L$ $R$ $d$

## Output

Print the number of multiples of $d$ among the integers between $L$ and $R$ (inclusive).

```input1
5 10 2
```

```output1
3
```

- Among the integers between $5$ and $10$, there are three multiples of $2$: $6$, $8$, and $10$.

```input2
6 20 7
```

```output2
2
```

- Among the integers between $6$ and $20$, there are two multiples of $7$: $7$ and $14$.

```input3
1 100 1
```

```output3
100
