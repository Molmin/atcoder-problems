## Problem Statement

Based on some criterion, Snuke divided the integers from $1$ through $12$ into three groups as shown in the figure below.
Given two integers $x$ and $y$ ($1 \leq x &lt; y \leq 12$), determine whether they belong to the same group.

## Constraints

- $x$ and $y$ are integers.
- $1 \leq x &lt; y \leq 12$

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $x$ $y$

## Output

If $x$ and $y$ belong to the same group, print `Yes`; otherwise, print `No`.

```input1
1 3
```

```output1
Yes
```

```input2
2 4
```

```output2
No
```
