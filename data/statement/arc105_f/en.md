## Problem Statement

Given is an undirected graph $G$ consisting of $N$ vertices numbered $1$ through $N$ and $M$ edges numbered $1$ through $M$. It is guaranteed that $G$ is connected and contains no self-loops and no multi-edges.
Edge $i$ connects Vertex $a_i$ and Vertex $b_i$ bidirectionally.
Each edge can be painted red or blue. Initially, every edge is painted red.

Consider making a new graph $G^{\prime}$ by removing zero or more edges from $G$.
There are $2^M$ graphs that $G^{\prime}$ can be. Among them, find the number of good graphs defined below, modulo $998244353$.

$G^{\prime}$ is said to be a *good graph* when both of the following conditions are satisfied:

- $G^{\prime}$ is connected.
- It is possible to make all edges blue by doing the following operation zero or more times.-   - Choose one vertex and change the color of every edge incident to that vertex, that is, red to blue and vice versa.

## Constraints

- All values in input are integers.
- $1 \leq N \leq 17$
- $N-1 \leq M \leq N(N-1)/2$
- $G$ is connected and has no self-loops and no multi-edges.

## Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

> $N$ $M$
> 
> $a_1$ $b_1$
> 
> $\vdots$
> 
> $a_M$ $b_M$

## Output

Print the number of good graphs among the ones that $G^{\prime}$ can be, modulo $998244353$.

```input1
3 2
1 2

```

```output1
1
```

- The conditions are satisfied only if neither Edge $1$ nor Edge $2$ is removed.-   - In this case, we can make all edges blue by, for example, doing the operation for Vertex $2$.
- Otherwise, the graph gets disconnected and thus does not satisfy the condition.
